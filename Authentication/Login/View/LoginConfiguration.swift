        - Parameters:
             - viewModel: view model to bind to and use.
             - viewFactory: factory method to call only once
             to get the login view to use.
             - transitionDelegate: delegate to handle events that fire a
             transition, like selecting registration or recover password.
             - delegate: delegate which adds behaviour to certain events,
             like handling a login error or selecting log in option.
             The default delegate is provided.
